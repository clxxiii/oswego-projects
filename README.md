# Hi.
These are files used as assignments at SUNY Oswego. Take a look if you need some inspiration for your own projects!

Please do not copy and paste, these files were a part of graded assignments, and I'm sure you know better than that.

## Just do your own work; you're getting graded to play with computers!
