# Hi.
These are files used as assignments at SUNY Oswego. Some of them are graded. If you're somehow here, despite the repo being private, taking anything from this repo is considered cheating and serious consequences could follow for the both of us. Take a look if you want, but plagiarism is still very valid in stealing my ideas or any of my code.
## Just do your own work; you're getting graded to play with computers.
