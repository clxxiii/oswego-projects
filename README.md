# Hi.
These are files used as assignments at SUNY Oswego. Some of them are graded. If you're somehow here, despite the repo being private, taking anything from this repo is considered cheating and could result in the both of us being put into serious consequences. Take a look if you want, but plagiarism is still very valid in the programming world.
